We also support new science and research and we engage with governments, management organizations, and NGOs to advance the global dialogue on ocean transparency.GFW processes a global database of vessel GPS positions, several terabytes in size, and applies machine learning models that infer each vessel’s type and size as well as when they are likely fishing. GFW is now developing new models, both on these GPS positions and on satellite imagery, to fully reveal activity in the world's oceans. These models include object detection from global feeds of satellite radar and optical imagery, and models that infer, based on vessel behavior, illegal activity and unreported catch. We believe that these new models have the potential to dramatically change the way we monitor and manage the world’s oceans.We are looking for a data scientist to join our research and innovation team to help develop these models. This team works closely with external GFW academic partners to develop models and research, and also with the internal GFW engineering team to scale our methods and put them into production.The Position Working closely with the GFW technical teams, the data scientist will help organize data and build models to understand several global datasets that reveal human activity on the world’s oceans. The two key types of data are 1) vessel GPS data and 2) satellite imagery (both optical and radar). A strong ability to work in R or Python is required, as well as abilities to manipulate data in SQL.The ideal candidate will be excited about working with global data, and will have a high aptitude for learning new techniques. Although it is obviously helpful, we do not expect that you already have a deep knowledge of building models or our key programming languages; we do expect that you have the aptitude to develop these skills and knowledge, and that you are excited about revealing human activity across the global ocean using these tools. Global Fishing Watch values working quickly, innovating, and working collaboratively. Our entire team works remotely, so the ideal candidate is able to manage their own time and be effective with limited daily oversight. Finally, we are passionate about producing research and datasets that will make a difference in how we manage the world’s oceans.The exact projects the data scientist will focus on will depend on the candidate and other factors at GFW. Possible projects include:Helping the machine learning engineers build models to identify fishing vessels from satellite and optical imagery -- experience with remote sensing, and especially synthetic aperture radar -- is helpfulCombining vessel detections from imagery with vessel GPS detections to identify vessels that are not broadcasting their locationsDeveloping models to estimate pollution from ocean going vessels, including noise pollutionUsing vessel behavior to identify vessels that have an elevated risk of using forced labor or engaging in other illegal activityCombing vessel tracking data with animal telemetry data (gps devices that have been attached to sharks and tunas) to build models to identify the likely catch and bycatch of ocean going vesselsCollaborating with the GFW engineering team to automate models.Engaging with GFW Research Partners to develop these models and publish peer reviewed papers (the GFW Research Program has produced more than 20 academic papers, including many published at top journals)Write blogs and present public visualizationsJob Requirements Required Technical SkillsDemonstrated skills with Python or R, with preference for PythonStrong SQL skillsStrong mathematical capabilitiesDemonstrated abilities to understand and interpret large datasets, including strong statistical understandingRequired Team and Communication SkillsTeam player, willing to work, teach, learn with/to/from the GFW teamProactive mindset – enjoys and exhibits a high-degree of ownership of tasks and projectsComfortable working in a small but fast growing organizationExcellent communication skills – in person, phone, and, most important, writtenComfortable communicating with a wide range of individuals, including peers, juniors and senior level people, and government officials from multiple countriesIntellectually curious, forward thinking, willing to suggest / try new technologies and creative approaches to problemsAbility to work in a remote-only distributed team (in more than 5 different time zones)Helpful Skills, but can be learned on the jobGoogle Earth EngineDistributed computation, such as Apache Beam (preferred), or Hadoop, Spark, etc.TensorflowNeural networksKnowledge about marine science and human impacts on the oceanDocumenting all knowledge produced so it can be distributed among the organization and to the publicLocation: GFW has a distributed workforce, with employees all over the world.This position will require the individual to have a time zone that overlaps significantly with California and Buenos Aires, with strong preference for U.S.Pacific, Central, or Mountain time.Responsible to: Research & Innovation DirectorSalary or Compensation: Commensurate with experience.

Drizly is the world’s largest alcohol marketplace and the best way to shop beer, wine and spirits. Our customers trust us to be part of their lives – their celebrations, parties, dinners and quiet nights at home. We are there when it matters - committed to life’s moments and the people who create them. We partner with the best retail stores in over 1200 cities across North America to serve up the best buying experience. Drizly offers a huge selection and competitive pricing with a side of personalized content. That is what we do. Who we are is a different story.
We are more than just another tech company. There is an intellectual curiosity that occurs at Drizly. We have a desire to question, to understand, to figure it out. Bottom line, we solve it. We value not just the truth but the process to get to the truth, to deliberate, decide and then act. Most importantly, we care. We care about our customer. We care about our company. We care about our team. There will be long days and incredible challenges.
We are blazing a trail in an industry that hasn’t changed in nearly a century, and that doesn’t scare us (well, not all the time) -and even when it does, it doesn’t stop us, it energizes us.
Do you see yourself here? Read on.
Who you are
You are currently at the intersection of data science and retention marketing analytics, and you want to dive even deeper into both worlds. You have the operational ability to improve Drizly’s current marketing automations, CRM workflow inefficiencies, consumer segmentation processes, and champion our product vision to build Drizly’s roadmap of personalization. You have the empathy to understand our business from the eyes of a consumer, and you have the results driven mindset to drive improvements to Drizly’s experience that move the bottom line. You have a technical toolset which includes complex SQL, Python, scikit, Git, visualization tools, etc).
You love working with teams including Data Engineering and Business Intelligence to transform raw data into highly actionable business insights through Looker, as well as partnering with retention marketing and product teams to turn those insights into action. You also know how to work the other direction - how to implement and manage retention initiatives to ensure that data collection is seamless and comprehensive. You have a proven track record designing, implementing, and measuring solutions in the analytics space.
If you're coming from a consumer-facing ecommerce marketplace, that’s great! We deal with massive amounts of messy and eventstream data from a variety of internal and external sources.
If you have also delivered event streaming solutions, even better! You will feel right at home if you have deployed and maintained production data science models, set up data pipelines with schema validation and testing, or worked on problems involving customer segmentation, uplift modeling, recommendations, and attribution.
What the role is
We are looking for someone to build the future of customer personalization at Drizly. This person will support and optimize existing marketing automations, and partner with product and marketing to drive meaningful personalization. They will create touchpoints that differentiate the Drizly shopping experience across web, mobile web + app, email, push, and more.
The Data Scientist is a critical member of the Analytics organization, and will work closely with Data Engineering and BI, as well as the cross-functional Retention Growth team. They will certainly be responsible for supporting individual campaigns and product solutions, but also for the larger vision of how a data architecture, codebase, and best practices for consumer retention should grow with Drizly over time. Ultimately, this person will determine the ground truth, roadmap, and reporting lens through which Drizly will be enabled to deliver memorable and relevant experiences for our customers.

In this role you will:
Partner with product and marketing to drive personalization at scale across the product and notification layer, across Drizly’s consumer apps, websites, email, push, and more
Develop and execute retention growth process improvements through a complete lifecycle of experimental design, testing, measurement, and implementation
Drive the analytics roadmap on activation, engagement, and churn; including survival analysis, consumer tiering, consumer pathing, rewards, and onboarding efficacy
Maintain and improve the data infrastructure, documentation, codebase, internal processes, and standards of the Analytics Team
Integrate consumer and operational data sets from multiple internal and external sources

The City University of New York (CUNY) - Office of Institutional Research and Assessment (OIRA) announces a one-year fellowship in the behavioral sciences. Behavioral science is the study of how people make decisions and act within a complex world where details and context matter. It draws from decades of research in the social sciences to create a more realistic framework for understanding the way people form intentions and take actions.

Behavioral science has been used across a variety of fields to realign policies, programs, and products with how we really behave, improving outcomes for millions of people worldwide. OIRA is testing the use of lessons from the behavioral sciences at CUNY through a project called the Student Persistence Initiative (SPI), which is funded by the Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity.

CUNY is the nation's leading urban public university serving more than 275,000 students in 25 colleges and institutions in New York City. CUNY-OIRA conducts research and provides data to improve student success and acts as an incubator for new interventions, providing rigorous evidence to identify the most effective, and taking the best to scale at CUNY. SPI is one of these projects.

Under the supervision of the Director for Institutional Research, the fellow will provide quantitative analytic support and data for the implementation and scaling of a set of behavioral interventions over the course of academic year 2020-21.

Job Description
You are a data scientist - soon to be known for building the “thermometer for the mind”: a system that encompasses...
streaming smartphone sensor data providing measures of human behavior,
batched electronic health records providing measures of health outcomes, and
state-of-the-art algorithms that map #1 to #2
... in order to get substance-use disorder patients the help they need at their most critical moments of recovery.
You're excited about changing the way we manage mental healthcare, using machine learning and artificial intelligence. Your modeling expertise is broad - you're familiar with a wide variety of modeling approaches, and you have a depth of intuition to choose the right approach for each task. You keep the end goal of delivering customer value in mind. This means you seek and respond to customer feedback about your outputs, and you navigate your approach towards results. You're more focused on results than tools - though you stay abreast of exciting developments in machine learning, you'll use a simple approach if it's the right one for the job.
You're familiar with best practices for codebase management and data security. You'll create a codebase that is well-documented, elegantly designed, and easy for others to use. And you have a security mindset, which you'll apply to ensuring that our handling of sensitive data meets the highest standards.
You're a visionary who will influence the future of data science & analytics at Aware Healthcare. Your understanding of our goals and of the possibilities of statistical inference will guide our product development, and direct our collection of data. You are excited to effectively manage new collaborators as our data science team grows.
Responsibilities
Design and build our core algorithms.
Design and train models that predict key targets (e.g. substance-use relapse).
Combine datastreams from disparate time-scales (monthly, weekly, daily, etc.) with data from electronic health records, to build a real-time predictive system.
Deliver data insights to customers.
Produce insights in a timely manner to ensure our delivery schedule is met.
Seek feedback from customers and rework algorithms and strategies accordingly.
Organize and manage our data science codebase.
Keep all code updated in well-organized and documented git repository.
Manage others' contributions to the codebase.
Act as “Chief Privacy Officer” for analytics and pipelining of data.
Know best practices and regulations for working with sensitive health data.
Work with data science team, research team, and software team to implement security practices during data exploration and processing.
Take leadership of the data science team.
Ensure the success of interns and other team members under your guidance.
Help decide which roles to hire for as the project grows.
Set strategy for our data science department.
Use experimental design considerations to shape our product, considering what data types we need and what we can predict from them.
Add your vision for how our products could grow and evolve.
Required Qualifications
Expert Python programmer, extremely proficient with the scipy stack (e.g. numpy, pandas, sci-kit learn, and matplotlib)
Broad and deep knowledge of machine learning algorithms, with a strong sense for which techniques fit a given situation.
Demonstrated ability to develop novel approaches to inference problems.
Experience working with version control tools such as git.
Extensive experience communicating technical findings to non-technical stakeholders.
Preferred Qualifications
Knowledgeable about securely handling sensitive data; experience working under a data security agreement (e.g. HIPAA BAAs).
Experience analyzing streaming, high-volume, noisy datasets, especially data from smartphones and wearable devices.
Previous contributions to enterprise-level software or analysis codebase.
Previous experience as an early employee at a fast-growing tech startup.
Leadership experience (hiring contractors, managing interns, etc).
Experience with cloud computing.
Experience in experimental design.
Experience analyzing electronic health records.
Who We Are: Aware Healthcare Inc.
Our Mission
Aware Healthcare is on a mission to build the “thermometer for the mind”: a digital medical device that delivers real-time measures of clinical risk to providers, about their patients, at the moments they need it most.
The current gold-standard of evaluation in psychiatry are pen & paper surveys that provide subjective, episodic, high-burden, and clinic-based measures of risk. Our thermometer allows providers to check the ‘mental temperature' of their patients — in an objective, continuous, ecological, and passive fashion — at any time.
Our Vision
With our thermometer, providers know who needs help, and when they need it. Not only does this shine light into the black box that currently defines life outside the clinic, but it allows providers to deliver just-in-time interventions to patients before it's too late. Trust in providers grows when patients know they're being looked out for. Population health flourishes when high-risk gets detected early. Per capita costs plummet when rates of readmission are reduced. Welcome to the triple-aim of healthcare.
We envision a world where we all have the vocabulary to describe how we're mentally feeling; self-awareness to identify when we're heading down a dark path; and tools to get help in minutes not weeks. We can't manage what we don't measure, so we see no more important problem than this for technology in healthcare.
Our Why
We are starting with addiction for several reasons. For one, it seems we've all been affected by or lost friends and family who have struggled with this chronic disease. Two, addiction is the most costly, preventable, and unmanaged disease in America; costing our nation over $700 billion per year and leading to over 70 other comorbid medical conditions. Three, most digital health companies have run away from addiction, because they see the problem as ‘too hard'; the patients as ‘unmanageable'; the suffering as ‘inevitable'. With over 16% of Americans meeting criteria for clinical addiction, and another 32% classifying as risky users, we see this as too big of a problem to ignore.
Join us in redefining what it means to know thyself, reconsidering how we measure population health, and revolutionizing the way we manage mental healthcare. Join us at Aware Healthcare.
How We Will Collaborate: Culture & Values
Work Culture
We're a small team looking for someone who's passionate about democratizing self-knowledge; relentless about getting help to those who need it most. You should be comfortable exploring outside your comfort zone; be ready to learn and constantly take on new challenges.
You should be known by your colleagues for never compromising on quality, while always moving quickly. On our team, no one is expected to know everything, but everyone is expected to be capable of learning independently, and applying that knowledge effectively.
This is a fast-paced role with many concurrent responsibilities, and it comes with a great deal of ownership. Chances are you will grow more in this role than any other role of your career. This idea should excite you, rather than scare you.
Team Values
Being on the Aware Healthcare team means you...
Take ownership: the buck stops at you; you are individually responsible.
Are proactive: you take initiative; identify problems before they happen.
Embrace risk: take courageous & calculated risks; no one gets banished for making mistakes.
Are radically candid: you expect truth and nothing but the truth; give & take constructive criticism.
Have a growth-mindset: we believe you can always be better & you should too; no one has ever ‘made it'.
Are insatiably curious: you have a desire to understand the world that can never be fully satisfied.
Practice humility: you don't know everything and you never will; embrace that and learn.
Focus on humans: always feel into the human experience at the other end of the machine.
Are playful: you work hard, laugh hard, and crack jokes in meetings.
Think slow: you choose careful deliberation over brash decisions."

If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don’t hesitate to apply (link at the bottom) or drop us a line with questions on engineering-recruitment@silverfin.com.

Ahum. Here it comes.

What’s a Silverfin?

At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimize their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.

The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every day more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 200.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in.

What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?

We’re a remote-first engineering team of 25 people distributed in 14 different countries. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring in this regard, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be.

Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids — whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organized that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.

Being remote-first means we favor asynchronous communication. We don’t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in our wiki, so there’s a written, persisted record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working!

We’d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too, as long as there’s no pandemic going around. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.

Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 7TB, and our largest table recently crossed the 10 billion row mark. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.

What does working at Silverfin look like?

You’ll take the lead in setting up the product, infrastructure and organisation to do smart things with all the data we have. Make the lives of our users easier. You’ll answer and implement questions like: Can a computer do a senior review based on historical comments? Can we generate suggestions for a tax calculation? Can bankruptcy be predicted before an accountant notices it? You might even come up with a few answerable questions yourself based on analysis of the data at hand. You will take charge of all the processes from data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing, to training models and deploying them to production.

We work in nimble teams of around 5 people in size, with each team taking ownership of a specific set of features of the application. As our first machine learning engineer, you’ll initially be a team of one, and while we expect you to be able to code most of the core parts yourself, you can rely on support from the other engineering and ops teams to integrate and deploy projects to production.

What does your future look like?

Initially you’ll work by yourself, but once things move in the right direction, we’re looking to quickly expand the team with you as the teamlead. You will be called on to help out with recruiting, managing and mentoring the other team members once that time comes.

Everyone has a €1000 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation and travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you’ll get paid like any normal day. Silverfin colleagues regularly visit conferences across the world.

What are we looking for?
You’re experienced in applying machine learning, from proof of concept to a production system. You’re able to both get your hands dirty building models, and integrating what you’ve built into a production system. While our core application is built in Ruby on Rails, it’s probably not well-suited for machine learning projects, and you can suggest a more applicable language based on the project. We’re guessing Python.
You’re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognize bikeshedding and can avoid its pitfalls.
You’re able to take initiative and push projects forward without being micromanaged.
You can code with reason and can justify the important decisions you made during development.
You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally.
You recognize and can apply engineering best practices when relevant. This includes the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but you also appreciate hygienic code, good naming, explicitness and readability over cleverness, etc. You’re willing to be flexible and pick-up other practices that the team decides on but you might not agree with.
You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project.
What can we offer you?
The opportunity to build unique projects based on a significant amount of data, on top of a solid product-oriented foundation
Actual, proper work-life balance
Choose your own working hours and work 100% remotely
Personal growth training and opportunities
The possibility to grow the team and become a teamlead
Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 25 colleagues in 14 different countries
A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues
A €1000 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills
Requirements
You have successfully taken a significant machine learning project from concept to production
At least 2 years of full-time experience with machine learning projects
Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)
Nice to have’s

These would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don’t worry if none of the following applies to you.

Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team
Experience in Fintech
Accounting knowledge

About Our Team:
The Data Science Team provides advanced analytical support across VNSNY’s family of corporations. We leverage big data to develop insights and to support strategic decisions for the agency. Meaningful, appropriate use of data is central to the success of our organization. We are looking for an ambitious data scientist to join our team.
About the Role:
The Data Scientist will join a core group of analysts who play an important role in generating strategic insights across the VNSNY organization in these four applications of data science:
Clinical - “Who is going to get sick? What can we do to prevent or mitigate these health events? When is the best time to implement these actions?” This application of data science examines the drivers of clinical outcomes; analyzes opportunities for managing risk-based populations; evaluates programs and interventions that aim to improve patient outcomes.
Quality – “How is quality of care measured and how is it related to patient outcomes? Where are opportunities to improve the quality of care to our patients and members?” Our data scientists serve as subject matter experts on healthcare quality measurement and risk adjustment; use predictive modeling to identify patient populations in need of clinical interventions; identify opportunities for improvement in clinical processes that can lead to improved quality of care.
Operational – “How can we optimize our business operations in order to be more efficient? How do we deliver our services in order to improve the coordination of care for our patients and members?” This application of data science focuses on efficiency and optimization of business practices in order to improve patient care; uses techniques including time series forecasting and geospatial analysis to address business problems such as staffing and scheduling; analyzes opportunities for business growth within the organization and predicts and forecasts expenses.
Policy – “What is the impact of health care policy on our patient population? On our most vulnerable patients and members? How will changes in reimbursement policy affect the way we deliver patient care? What partnerships can we develop in order to ensure that our patients and members continue receiving optimal care?” Our data scientists are well-versed in healthcare policy; analyze areas for meaningful value investments that focus on improving health outcomes while saving money; use predictive modeling to identify high cost and high need patient populations who may be impacted most by changes in health policy.

Driven by curiosity and a passion to learn, you thrive in situations where you can bring clarity to ambiguous and multi-faceted problems
A logical thinker who is comfortable learning new programming languages and computing applications independently

Love the challenge of exploring new data sources while practicing a healthy skepticism about data; when you find data that looks wrong, you are emotionally compelled to figure out why
Have a desire to use your analytical skills to make measurable impacts on the lives of patients
Requirements:

Dyno’s groundbreaking engineering pipeline harnesses advances in DNA library synthesis, high-throughput sequencing, and machine learning to generate transformative gene therapy vectors. We target the major barriers that separate AAV gene therapy research from real-world therapies, including delivery efficiency, tissue and cell-type specificity, immune evasion, and more. Our vectors will accelerate the transition of gene therapies from the lab to the clinic for the benefit of patients worldwide.

NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals to collaborate in both long and short term work to solve mission-critical problems. To solve the problems generated by NSA's mission, mathematicians draw from a wide body of mathematical knowledge, including number theory, abstract algebra, graph theory, combinatorics, analysis, probability, statistics and more. However, the essential ingredient to the solution of a problem is often not mathematical knowledge per se, but the keen analytic ability that a mathematician possesses through training and talent.
